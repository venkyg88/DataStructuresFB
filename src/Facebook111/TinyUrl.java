/* Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL. */

    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    public String encode(String longUrl) {
        map.put(i, longUrl);
        return "http://tinyurl.com/" + i++;

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// TinyUrl codec = new TinyUrl();
// codec.decode(codec.encode(url));
